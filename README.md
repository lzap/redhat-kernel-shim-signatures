# Red Hat / CentOS kernel shim signatures

This git repository contains shim signatures (SHA-256) for all released RHEL
and CentOS versions.

## Description

Due to hardening within the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 kernel, which was
released as part of the
[CVE-2020-10713](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10713) update,
previous Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 kernel versions have not been added to
shimâ€™s allow list. If you are running with Secure Boot enabled, and the user
needs to boot to an older kernel version, its hash must be manually enrolled
into the trust list. This is achieved by executing the following commands:

    # pesign -P -h -i /boot/vmlinuz-<version>
    # mokutil --import-hash <hash value returned from pesign>
    # reboot

This can be problem when PXE or UEFI HTTP booting older kickstart trees via
grub2 bootloader which comes from newer version of RHEL or CentOS, for example
when using Foreman, Katello, Orachino or Red Hat Satellite.

## Hashes

## Example

To import CentOS 8.0 kernel signature to a target host (a server that needs to
be provisioned), boot it in SecureBoot EFI mode and do:

    mokutil --import-hash 386dd5097c3306c8d55a173b5809b5dc7440d973762d69d59c9698b06449513a

## Symptoms

An error occurs during RHEL 8 or CentOS 8 procedure:

    error: /vmlinuz-X.Y.Z-AAA.B.C.el8.x86_64 has invalid signature.
    error: you need to load the kernel first
    Press any key to continue...

## Version not listed here

Use shell scripts in this repository to fetch and extract the signature. Only
`bash`, `wget` and `pesign` tools are required.

## Contributing

Feel free to file a Pull Request if there are new versions of RHEL released, I
will do my best to update this git repository regularly.
